# Reshaping the Retail Industry using AI Vision

This repository contains the code and resources for the project "Reshaping the Retail Industry using AI Vision" developed by Group 7 as part of the COS30018 Intelligent Systems course.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a system that utilizes AI vision to address the challenges of out-of-stock detection and product management in the retail industry. The system aims to enhance inventory management, shelf organization, and real-time monitoring, ultimately improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The project involves the following key components:

1. **Data Collection and Annotation**: The team collected and annotated datasets for out-of-stock items and unorganized shelf displays, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the data.

2. **Object Detection Models**: Two distinct object detection pipelines were developed and compared:
   - One-Class Object Detection: Separate models were trained for out-of-stock detection and unorganized shelf evaluation.
   - Multi-Class Object Detection: A unified model was trained to detect and classify both out-of-stock and unorganized shelf scenarios.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The object detection models were trained using the annotated datasets and evaluated using various metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP).

4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly GUI was developed to enable seamless interaction with the object detection system, allowing users to upload images, videos, and stream live video for real-time detection.

5. **Practical Applications**: The developed system offers practical applications in inventory management, shelf management, and real-time monitoring, contributing to enhanced retail operations and customer experience.
